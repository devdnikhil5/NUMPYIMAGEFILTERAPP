# 🖼️ NumPy Image Filter App (Tkinter + Matplotlib + PIL)

A simple yet powerful **Image Filter Application** built using **Python, Tkinter, Matplotlib, NumPy, and PIL (Pillow)**.  
This app allows you to **load an image and apply multiple real-time image filters** such as grayscale, negative, sepia, blur, sharpen, edge detection, and more — all powered by NumPy operations.

| **Grayscale** | Converts the image to shades of gray |
| **Negative** | Inverts image colors for a photo-negative effect |
| **Brighten** | Increases brightness of the image |
| **Blur** | Applies a basic box blur using convolution |
| **Sepia** | Gives a warm, vintage photo tone |
| **Cool Tone** | Adds a blueish hue by adjusting RGB channels |
| **Edge Detect** | Detects edges using the Sobel operator |
| **Sharpen** | Enhances image clarity and edges |
| **Flip Horizontal** | Mirrors the image horizontally |
| **Flip Vertical** | Flips the image upside-down |
